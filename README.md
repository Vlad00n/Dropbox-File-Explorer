Hello. I'm not a programmer/coder - I've started a course about Python : [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp]. Then I have decided to try and build a program that could explore my Dropbox files with just double click of the mouse. Of course I've used ChatGPT...
So I ended up with this simple program - Dropbox FileExplorer. It is not perfect, it's not something that could impress people or companies, but I like what I was able to build. I will continue to try to improve it.
I hope if someone who decides to try it to like it.
Thank you.
